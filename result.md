##      PRIVATE INITIATIVE

*      Traditionally, infrastructure projects in India were owned and
       managed by the government or a government undertaking. Given the
       massive investments required infrastructure, there is now a broad
       consensus that private sector participation in this activity must
       be encouraged
*      Private initiative in infrastructure projects can take many forms,
       ranging from contracted operation of public utilities to full
       ownership, operation and maintenance of these facilities
*      A typical example is an electricity generation project which the
       private sector builds, owns, operates for a certain period of time
       (called the “Concession Period”) and finally transfers back to the
       government. This concept is called BOOT.
*      For a road project, the private sector may be invited simply to
       build the facility, operate it during Concession Period and
       finally, at the end of the concession period, transfer the facility
       back to the government (BOT) without actually ever owning the same.

---

###      Typical Project Configuration

*      The project is implemented by a Special Purpose Vehicle, which is a
       distinct corporate entity.
*      Project sponsors take an equity stake in the SPV.
*      The SPV enters into contractual arrangements with project
       contractors, offtakers, operators, government, and project lenders.
*      The dependence on debt is usually high and lenders generally lend
       on a non-recourse basis. This means that project lenders would not
       have any fall-back on the resources/assets of the sponsors if the
       SPV fails to meet debt servicing obligations.
*      The contracts are as ironclad as possible and are less left to
       subjective interpretation as possible.

---

###      Key Project Parties

*      Project sponsors
*      Project vehicle
*      Project lenders
*      EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) contractor
*      O & M (operations and maintenance) contractor
*      Government

---

###      Project Contracts

*      Through a comprehensive web of contracts, every major risk inherent
       in the project is allocated to the party / parties that is best
       able to assess and manage the risk
*      The project contracts are:
*       Shareholders Agreement
*       EPC Contract
*      Project Loan Agreements
*       O & M Contract

---

###      Financial Structure and Corporate Governance

*      Many argue that the essence of project finance is the web of
       contracts meant to ensure that all parties work in concert for the
       success of the project, to distribute risks efficiently, and to
       prevent the abuse of monopoly power.
*      This argument is valid but incomplete because it does not explain
       why a project is handled as a separate company, why project parties
       participate in the equity of the company, and why the project
       company relies heavily on debt in the form of non-recourse
       financing and limited recourse financing
*      Separate SPVs ensure that multiple concessions with different or
       conflicting terms are not imposed on the same SPV. It also enhances
       the trade ability of these SPVs.
*      As it is not possible to write comprehensive contracts (which can
       envisage every possible contingency) and monitor them effectively,
       equity participation of various stakeholders makes them more
       committed to the project.
*      Separately identifiable and assured cash flows facilitate a greater
       reliance on debt in the form of non-recourse or limited recourse
       financing.

###      Parties in a Power Project

##      EPC

*      Contractor
*      Sponsors/Other Shareholders
*      Fuel
*      Supplier
*      State Electricity
*      Board (Offtaker)
*      Project Company (SPV)
##      O and M

*      Contractor
*      Project Lenders
*      State Government

---

###      Features of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)

*      The PPA establishes the conditions under which the SPV would sell
       power to the SEB
*      The SEB guarantees a minimum offtake from the SPV or, if it fails
       to do, a minimum payment
*      A payment mechanism and and a security mechanism that ensures
       availability of payments on time is established. In India, several
       large projects have been financed on the basis of a 3 tier security
       mechanism
*      Level 1 : Letter of credit
*      Level 2 : Escrow account
*      Level 3 : Irrevocable guarantee of the state government
*      The formula for computing tariffs
*      Termination under conditions of sustained default by either the SPV
       or the SEB.

###      Telecommunication Projects

*      Telecommunication projects are characterised by large project
       costs, a virtually continuous project implementation (or roll–out),
       long gestation periods, and a dispersed customer base that exposes
       the project to commercial risks and requires significant marketing
       and selling budgets. In telecom projects, in practice there can be
       no single COD ( Commercial Operations Date).
*      In general, telecom projects incur cash losses in initial years and
       these need to be funded. Unlike a power project which generates
       reasonably flat revenues and profitability over its life, telecom
       projects, by virtue of their continued implementation and increase
       in subscriber base demonstrate increases in profitability over a
       period of time.
*      Private telecom projects operate under a license from the
       Department of Telecom and the projects framework is determined by
       the conditions of the license.

---

###      Factors considered by Project Financiers in a Telecommunication

*        project
*      Conditions imposed by the license
*      Equipment supply contract(s)
*      Financial strength of the project sponsors
*      Business plan assumptions
*      Competitive environment

---

###      Financing Telecommunication Projects

*      In general, telecom projects incur cash losses in initial years and
       these need to be funded. In determining a telecom project’s cost,
       lenders follow the concept of “ peak Negative Cash Flow Period,”
       which determines the maximum period over which the project requires
       external cash infusion and the total external financing
       requirements during the period.
*      Given the long gestation periods and the commercial risks, project
       lenders in India have funded telecom projects on a lower
       debt-equity ratio (DER) such as around 1:1

---

###      Infrastructure Financing Scenario in India

*      Due to their complex nature, infrastructure projects have
       historically been funded by banks and financial institutions, SBI,
       IDFC, ICICI, IDBI, and PFC being the key financiers.
*      In recent times, there has been an increasing interest from the
       capital markets in financing equity requirements in well-structured
       infrastructure projects.
*      Banks have become more responsive and are now willing to lend upto
       tenors of 12 to 20 years.
*      A large part of the Golden Quadrilateral is based on a fixed
       annuity payment to contractors on a build-operate-transfer (BOT)
       model.
*      An operate-maintain-transfer (OMT) model is emerging for road
       financing. Under this arrangement, the government funds the road
       while the contractor operates and maintains it for a fee and then
       transfers it for a fee.
*      There has been a fair amount of action in seaports in the last few
       years
*      The Government of India has recently approved five ultra- mega
       power projects to come up in the private sector.
*      Telecom operators in the private sector have been funded by debt
       and equity, coming in good measure from foreign sources.

###      Managing Risks in Private Infrastructure Projects

*      Construction Risk
*      Operating Risk
*      Interest Rate Risk
*      Foreign Exchange Risk
*      Payment Risk
*      Regulatory Risk
*      Political Risk

###      What Is a PPP?

*      Broadly a PPP refers to a contractual partnership between the
       public and private sector agencies in which the private sector is
       entrusted with the task of providing infrastructure facilities and
       services that were traditionally provided by the public sector. An
       example of a PPP is a toll expressway project financed,
       constructed, and operated by a private developer.
*      According to the Government of India, a PPP project is a project
       based on a contract or concession agreement between a government or
       statutory entity and a private sector company for delivering an
       infrastructure service on payment of user charges. A private sector
       company is a company in which 51 percent or more of equity is owned
       and controlled by a private entity.

---

###      Relevance of PPPs in India

*      India, the second fastest growing and the fourth largest economy of
       the world (in terms of PPP), faces huge gaps between the demand and
       supply of essential social and economic infrastructure and
       services. There is a shortage of power, roads, ports (airports and
       seaports), irrigation facilities, water and sanitation services,
       and so on. The deficient infrastructure is a major constraint in
       sustaining, deepening, and expanding India’s economic growth and
       competitiveness. It also impedes inclusive growth and poverty
       alleviation.
*      Recognising the importance of infrastructure, the Government of
       India (GOI) has stepped up its spending on infrastructure through a
       series of national programs such as the National Highway
       Development Program (NHDP), Bharath Nirman, Providing Urban
       Services in Rural Areas (PURA), Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban
       Renewal Mission (JNNURM), the Prime Minister’s Rural Road Program,
       National Rail Vikas Yojana, National Maritime Development Program
       (NMDP), airport expansion program, and so on. However, the
       estimated investment requirements are far greater than governmental
       resources. So, the Approach Paper to the Eleventh Plan has argued
       for reaching out to the private sector and private savings and
       aggressively promoting private partnership in infrastructure
       development. The National Development Council (NDC) has passed a
       resolution which says that “increased private sector participation
       has now become a necessity” for mobilising the resources required
       for infrastructure expansion and upgradation.

###      Key Government Initiatives

*      To give impetus to PPPs several initiatives have been taken. The
       GOI has established a Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure (COI), a
       high-level Committee of Secretaries, a PPP Appraisal Committee
       (PPPAC) on the model of the Public Investment Board (PIB), and
       several task forces to streamline decision making and
       operationalise PPPs. It has established the Viability Gap Funding
       (VGF) scheme and the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited
       (IIFCL) to provide long-term finance to PPP projects.
*      The GOI is working on several initiatives to assist and encourage
       capacity building at the state and central levels. It is providing
       assistance for creating state level PPP cells as nodal agency,
       streamlining their approval process, and developing PPP toolkits
       (model concession agreements, project manuals, bidding documents,
       and project preparation manuals).

---

###      The Way Forward

*      In order to accelerate PPPs the following are needed:
*      A stronger policy and regulatory framework has to be created, both
       at the centre and the states. The US-India CEO forum has called for
       a policy and regulatory framework that fosters efficiency and
       transparency in the bidding process, ensures sanctity of contracts,
       encourages competition, promotes market-driven tariffs, and
       separates regulatory and adjudication authorities.
*      The availability of long term equity and debt for PPPs has to be
       augmented through suitable instruments and mechanisms.
*      The shelf of bankable PPP projects has to be expanded.
*      The capacity of the government to manage PPP projects has to be
       substantially strengthened.
*      The government should expeditiously award contracts, facilitate
       land acquisition, and ensure better coordination between the centre
       and states. In particular, large size PPP projects may be put out
       for bidding after obtaining mandatory clearances and approvals,
       preferably through a Shell Company / Special Purpose Vehicle as was
       done recently in the case of Ultra Mega Power Projects.

##      SUMMARY

*      While traditionally infrastructure projects in India were owned and
       managed by the government undertaking, there is now a broad
       consensus that private sector participation in this activity must
       be encouraged.
*      The key features of project finance which appears to be the
       principal arrangement for private sector participation in
       infrastructure projects are as follows: (i) The project is set up
       as a separate company which is granted a concession by the
       government. (ii) The sponsor company which promotes the project
       usually takes a substantial stake in the equity of the project and
       enjoys the overall responsibility for running the project. (iii)
       The project company enters into comprehensive contractual
       arrangements with various parties like contractors, suppliers, and
       customers. (iv) The project company employs a high debt-equity
       ratio, with lenders having no recourse or limited recourse to the
       sponsor company or to the government in the event of default.
*      The key differentiating feature of project finance is the manner in
       which project risks are allocated to various parties involved in
       the project. Through a comprehensive web of contracts, every major
       risk inherent in the project is allocated to the party/parties that
       is best able to assess and manage that risk.

###      The key project parties are project sponsors, project vehicle,

*        project lenders, EPC contractors, O & M contractor, and the
       government.
*      The main project contracts are : shareholders agreement, EPC
       contract, project loan agreements, and O & M contract.
*      In the case of a power project, the power purchase agreement (PPA)
       establishes the conditions under which the SPV would sell power to
       the SEB, the SEB guarantee for a minimum takeoff, the payment and
       security mechanism, the formula for computing tariffs, and the
       provision for termination.
*      Financiers of a telecommunication project consider the following
       factors: conditions imposed by the license, equipment supply
       contract (s), financial strength of the project sponsors, business
       plan assumptions, and competitive environment
*      Due to their complex nature, infrastructure projects have
       historically been funded by banks and financial institutions. In
       recent times, there has been an increasing interest from the
       capital markets in financing equity requirements in well-structured
       infrastructure projects.
*      Broadly, a PPP refers to a contractual partnership between the
       public and private sector agencies in which the private sector is
       entrusted with the task of providing infrastructure facilities and
       services that were traditionally provided by the public.
